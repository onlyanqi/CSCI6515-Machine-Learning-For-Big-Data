yes so yesterday I was working on the image zooming on the main product page and it went all right
I was using a zoom FX plugin and that seem to work fine
We did some tests against jQuery and now it just was not going to be as performant
So we are going to use the zoom FX plugin and it seems to be handling large images
I will work on that to make sure it serves okay today 
I am going to get any blockers unless we have any memory issues all is good
