## Assignment1
Someone has suffered from headache. Our task is to analyse most important factors for his headache.
Resources: 
*1. The journal of his headaches time
*2. Halifax's weather (being near the ocean)
*3. The journal for his activities and work hours

We pre-processed all collected data in Python and run some descriptive statistics such as mean and standard deviation for extracted factors.
Finally, we created a model and use a decision tree to see what is the most important factors for his headache.


## Assignment2
Social Media becomes an effective way for social influencers to directly raise public attention to act on important things. In North American, Twitter is one of the most influential digital information media. 
During Covid-19, the change in cases is an important index to see whether public health authorities’ social media behaviour impacts the public’s positive response.
In this assignment, we are analyzing the effectiveness of social media (Twitter), the decisions and information from authoritative institutions and health organizations, on the spread of COVID-19.

## Assignment3
The main purpose of this assignment is to generate a summary report for the scrum meeting management. We are going to benefit from both text and audio clustering to generate this report.
Our task has two steps. First, get the audio of one stand-up meeting and cluster the audio based on the features of team members voice. The output of this step is segments of the audio that each member speaks. 
In the second step, we will cluster the speech of each speaker into three segments and use a similarity measure, create three clusters for the whole meeting.

## Assignment4
Select three text files of our choice to work on them. Make sure they are at least contain 30 paragraphs.
Conduct a research on the subject of Text Summarization Techniques and find two methods of Text Summarization. 
Implement two selected model in Python and use the three selected files for evaluation and comparing the selected models.
We have chosen and implemented Frequency Driven, Text Rank, and Sequence to Sequence as effective text summarization methods in this assignment.

## Project
To generate photo captions, generally, we make the Input as an image and transform the visual information into text captions to describe it as an output.
It is a popular but diffcult topic as it combines computer vision and natural language processing.
The project is using a large volume of image data and corresponding caption text data to train a prediction model. It involves the modules we have discussed in the classes, such as data prepossessing of images and texts, building a model for training, validation and testing, evaluating the results using appropriate solutions, and data visualization of showing data set information and model progress.
